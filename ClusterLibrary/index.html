<h1> Cluster Algebra Library </h1>
<p> This is a place to explore and summarize the important information in a cluster algebra </p>
<p> Currently you explore the codimension 1 subalgebras, isomorphism classes of quivers and in some cases orbits of X-coordinates. Each page shows the full cluster complex for the subalgebra. You can then "focus" on various features by choosing the appropriate button.</p>
<h3> Codimension 1 Subalgebras </h3>
<p> We group the subalgebras by their "cluster type" following the Lie Algebra type classification of finite cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky. In addition each codimension 1 subalgebra is labeled by the single A coordinate  that was frozen to create the subalgebra.</p>
<h3> X Coordinates </h3>
Each edge of the cluster complex corresponds to an X coordinate (up to inverse). We show orbits of X coordinates by the cluster modular group (symmetry of the cluster complex).

<h2> Grassmannian Cluster Algebras </h2>
<h3> Special notation for Gr(2,n) </h3>
<p> In cluster algebras associated to Gr(2,n) all the A coordinates are "Plucker coordinates." For example "p34" corresponds to the function that take the determinant of the third and fourth columns of the 2xn matrix associated to a point in Gr(2,n) </p>
<p> The X coordinates in Gr(2,n) correspond to "cross ratios". They depend on 4 indices and so we write x1234 as short hand for (p12 * p23)/(p14 * p23). The seeds of Gr(2,n) are in bijective correspondence with triangulations of an n-gon. Under this correspondence pij corresponds to the diagonal from vertex i to vertex j. Each X coordinate corresponds to a quadrilateral. The cluster modular group corresponds to rotation of the regular n-gon. </p>

<h3> Special notation for Gr(3,6) </h3>
<p> In Gr(3,6) every A coordinate is either a Plucker coordinate pijk or one of two exotic coordinate e2x or e2y. See Scott's  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0311148"> paper </a>for more information on these coordinates.</p>

<h3> Special notation for Gr(3,7) </h3>
<p> In Gr(3,7) every A coordinate is either a Plucker coordinate pijk or one a version e2x or e2y corresponding to 6 of the 7 possible columns. For example e2x3 corresponds to e2x if we removed the third column of the 2x7 matrix. See Scott's  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0311148"> paper </a> for more information on these coordinates.</p>

<h2> Triangulations of Annulus </h2>
<h3> Special notation for A(p,q) Affine </h3>
<p> All of these cluster algebras are infinite and so we can only show a finite subset of the cluster complex. The infiteness is due to the action of the mapping class group of the annulus, which is generated by a Dehn twist around the center. As such the cluster complex repeats the pattern shown in both directions. </p>
<p> The A coordinates correspond to arcs between the p marked points on the inner boundary component and the q marked points on the outer boundary. We label the marked points 0 to p-1 and 0 to q-1 clockwise around each boundary. An arc with both endpoints on the inner boundary component is labeled iXYw0 for the clockwise arc from X to Y and iXYw1 for the counterclockwise arc. Similary oXYw0 is a clockwise arc between two outer point and oXYw1 is counterclockwise. Edges cXYwN are edges from inner point X to outer point Y winding N times around the annulus.
